# MetCollection
A visualisation of the origins of the MET Gallery collection created using P5.js.
Based on the following example for Mappa.js - https://mappa.js.org/docs/animated-meteorite-landings.html


The following dataset was used - https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess/blob/master/MetObjects.csv
This dataset was cleaned using Python and due to missing information, dating ambiguity, or to the presence of antiquated names for countries, only half of the dataset was usable. Nevertheless, the visualisation documents the origins of about 200,000 items in the museum.
